Foot for shower shelves
=======================

I've got some shelves in my bathroom and I made these little 3D printed plastic feet for them to:

* Keep them from getting wet when I wash the floor
* Compensate for the concave slope of the floor, so that the shelves stand up straight and parallel to the wall
